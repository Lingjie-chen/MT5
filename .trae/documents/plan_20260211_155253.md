I have analyzed the code and identified that while the ORB strategy override is present, the **Pre-Market Check (Q8)** and **Logic Consistency Check (Q1/Q5)** in the execution phase can still block the trade if the AI's analysis contradicts the ORB signal.

To "strictly execute" ORB entries as requested, I will modify the **ORB Strategy Override** block in `src/trading_bot/main.py` to forcibly align the AI's Pre-Market Check results with the ORB signal.

**Proposed Changes:**

1. **Modify** **`src/trading_bot/main.py`** **(around line 3594)**:

   * In the `if orb_signal_data:` block:

   * Force `strategy['pre_market_check']['q8_execution'] = 'Yes'`.

   * Force `strategy['pre_market_check']['q1_trend']` and `strategy['pre_market_check']['q5_bias']` to match the ORB direction (e.g., "Bullish (ORB Override)").

   * This ensures that the downstream "Pre-Market Check Enforcement" and "Logic Conflict" safety guards will **not** block the valid ORB signal.

**Effect:**

* When an ORB signal occurs, the bot will bypass AI hesitation (Q8="No") and AI trend disagreement (Q1="Bearish" vs ORB Buy).

* The trade will be executed immediately with the confidence score of 95.
